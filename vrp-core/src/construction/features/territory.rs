//! A feature that builds balanced, capacity-aware territories around a per-driver anchor list.
//!
//! PULL is a per-driver *weighted* overlap penalty: each job is billed the excess of its driver's
//! power distance (`proximity − weight`) over the minimum power distance across the job's
//! compatible anchors, so a job reaching into a foreign power cell is penalized and a job in its
//! own cell is free. PUSH greedily moves over-quota surplus to the nearest under-quota driver at
//! proximity cost. Anchors and weights are supplied by the caller (objective config) and are never
//! derived anywhere — an empty anchor map is a territory nobody holds, not a request to invent one.
//! The per-driver quota may be supplied too (see [`TerritoryFeatureBuilder::set_quotas`]), and is
//! otherwise derived from total demand.

/// Restores the quadratic term's weight in the regime the feature's own tests exercise.
/// `surplus²/quota` alone is below `surplus` for every surplus under quota — at a surplus of a
/// quarter to a third of quota, which is what the territory fixtures produce, it drops the balance
/// term to 27-33% of its linear weight and transport cost outbids it.
///
/// Bracketed from both sides by the vrp-pragmatic fixtures, and there is no room to round it off.
/// Both edges are the tipping point of one discrete "move this job or leave it" decision on a
/// six-job problem, so both are analytic and both were located to four decimals:
///
/// - **Low, 35/12 ≈ 2.9167**, from `territory_balances_for_each_metric`'s ProductionValue arm.
///   Values 2,3 | 3,3,2,2 over two equal drivers ⇒ `avg_metric` 2.5, quota 7.5 each, anchors 60
///   apart, and the cost-only split is 5/10. Leaving it there is a surplus of 2.5 ⇒
///   `(2.5/2.5) × GAIN × (2.5/7.5) × 60 = 20 × GAIN`, with no PULL. Moving driver1's boundary job
///   (value 3, sitting 2 from its own anchor and 58 from driver0's) leaves a surplus of 0.5 ⇒
///   `(0.5/2.5) × GAIN × (0.5/7.5) × 60 = 0.8 × GAIN`, plus `58 − 2 = 56` of PULL. Balancing wins
///   only while `20 × GAIN > 0.8 × GAIN + 56`, i.e. `GAIN > 56/19.2`. Below it the arm settles back
///   on 5/10.
/// - **High, 10/3 ≈ 3.3333**, from `supplied_weights_pull_work_toward_the_heavier_driver` (with
///   `supplied_weights_ignore_unknown_keys_and_default_absent_drivers_to_zero` failing alongside
///   it). That fixture's second job crossing costs `60 × GAIN` against a power weight worth 200, so
///   above 10/3 PUSH outbids the supplied weights and the split settles on 2/4 instead of 1/5.
///
/// Measured: 2.9166 red / 2.9167 green, 3.33 green / 3.34 red, each side unanimous over repeated
/// runs. 3.0 sits inside. The vrp-core unit tests then pin it exactly rather than bracket it —
/// `derived_quotas_produce_exact_pull_and_push` and friends assert PUSH totals worked out at this
/// value — so moving the gain means recomputing those numbers, not just re-probing the window.
///
/// Normalizing the PUSH fitness by `avg_metric` (see [`TerritoryShared::push`]) left the *upper*
/// edge and every Activities-driven edge exactly where they were — `avg_metric` is 1 when the metric
/// is activity count, so the division is the identity there, and
/// `territory_forms_balanced_clusters_from_shared_start` still fails at 2.8 and passes at 2.85 as
/// before. What moved is which fixture binds from below. The same equation without the
/// `/avg_metric` reads `50 × GAIN > 2 × GAIN + 56`, i.e. `GAIN > 7/6` — well under the Activities
/// edge, so the ProductionValue arm never bound. Normalizing lifted it by exactly `avg_metric` (2.5)
/// to 35/12, which lands just past that edge. So the window is near enough the one the raw-sum
/// formula had, now held from below by a different constraint — which is the point: with both terms
/// in jobs × distance, this gain no longer means something different per balance metric.
///
/// Those pragmatic fixtures drive a stochastic solver (`Environment::default()` seeds
/// `DefaultRandom` from entropy, not a fixed seed), so treat a single red run near an edge as
